#Task 1.11. FUNCTIONS OF THE INFINITIVE. Read the sentences, translate them into Ukrainian and put questions to the underlined words:

Subject

: What does patenting an invention mean?

Part of the Predicate

: What is needed to compile a poor game?

#Read and compare these sentences:

I noticed that he entered the laboratory.
I noticed him enter the laboratory.
The statements are adequate, but they differ in structure. The first sentence is
complex, and the second one is simple with the so-called complex object “him
enter” which consists of a noun or a pronoun in the objective case and an infinitive with
or without particle “to”. The second sentence is more characteristic of modem English.
The verbs followed by a complex object can be subdivided into three groups:
(a) the verbs expressing a will, requirement, request or permission (to want, desire,
require, demand, request, allow, permit, etc.) which are followed by the infinitive with
the particle “to
e.g.
His parents want him to become a manager.
(b) the verbs of mental perception (to know, think, believe, consider, find, expect,
suppose, etc.) which are followed by the infinitive with the particle “to ” , e.g.
We suppose her to be working on her course project now.
(c) the verbs of sense perception (to see, watch, notice, hear, feel, etc.) and verbs “to let”
and “to make” which are followed by the infinitive without “to”, e.g.
I’ve heard them speak German.
