# How to create a successful website?

## introduction

If you want to create a website and don't really have
a good understanding of what to focus on, this essay
might help you decide. The main points are:

- write something unique on your website, or something useful
- don't put ads and annoying scripts on your webpage
- design also matters.

## what matters

The main reason people go on the web is the information. They
need to gain knowledge on a specific topic and they want to
gain it fast, so if you write good tutorials or manuals for
anything, somebody is definitely going to notice it.

Another reason (which, if you think, is part of information) is
entertainment. So you can also try to write some stories or
what else you find entertaining.

## Don't profit from evil

If you are looking for a way to monetize your work, it's okay/
You can put credit card requisites and/or cryptocurrency wallet
addresses on your webpage so that people can support you if
they want to. You might as well start to sell something physical
through your website.

But don't ever try to gain money by adding advertisements
or tracking scripts to your site (ideally no javascript at all,
this will also increase your audience), this will annoy anybody who
visits it, and also is inherently unethical to do.

## Make your webpage look good

This is not essential, especially if you write something that
is extremely interesting or useful on your website, but people
like pretty things, so adding a little style to it won't do any
harm and can actually please your readers.

## Conclusion

I really encourage you to make your own site. Even if it doesn't
gain much popularity, it is definitely a cool project to do, and
may help you ease your mind a little.
