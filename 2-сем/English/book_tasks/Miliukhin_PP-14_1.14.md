# A. Define the forms of the infinitives used.

Young people have ambitions to ***become*** specialists in various fields of human
activity. Lviv Polytechnic National University is one of the best schools of higher
learning for those who wish to ***dedicate*** their lives to science and engineering. It is
known to ***have trained*** a lot of graduates who became famous scientists and
outstanding engineers. Most young people ***are likely to find*** here a field of study to
their liking.

The University offers courses in more than 50 subject areas. A list of the main
subject areas one ***can choose*** to major in ***may be found*** in the text about LPNU in
Getting on in English, a textbook for first-year students. To be ***enrolled*** in the
University one must pass entrance exams ***to testify*** to the effect that he or she has the
necessary knowledge required for them to be able to master the material ***to be taught*** at
the undergraduate level leading to the award of a bachelor’s degree after a four-year
course of studies. Those who wish ***to obtain*** a specialist’s degree or gain a master’s
degree have ***to continue*** their study and research for a further year or two depending on
the programme of their choice. The curricula of the courses in each subject area are
constantly revised and updated ***to take*** into account achievements in science and new
developments in technology.

During the undergraduate course the would-be researchers and engineers are
taught fundamentals of the fields of science ***to form*** a sound scientific basis for their
future specialities. In many cases a systems approach to subject areas is practised in
order ***to develop*** student’s ability ***to reason***. For instance, ***to understand*** how radio
works, it is more important ***to understand*** the function of each unit than to know what
components are used. This is known to be a systems approach to electronics. Similar
examples can be given to illustrate the peculiarities of other subject areas.

# B. Define the functions of the infinitives printed in bold type:

To master the main principles of scientific research is the major task for
graduate students who qualified to follow a master’s course. Students should know
that to understand many complicated phenomena in terms of a few simple principles
scientists develop theories. But to be taught basic theories is not sufficient for one to
make a good specialist. So to be provided with experimental evidence for the
theoretical ideas students are made to carry out more and more complicated
experiments.

Knowledge of a foreign language is essential for a specialist with a university
degree. So the curriculum in engineering includes a foreign language as an obligatory
subject to be taken by every student. And the would-be highly qualified specialists are
glad to be given an opportunity to improve their knowledge of a foreign language or to
take a second foreign language. Some undergraduates are likely to be learning two
foreign languages simultaneously. English is the most popular with students of all
specialities. The course aims to develop all four skills through a series of tasks and
activities that encourage students to combine their knowledge of English with their
technical knowledge.

Graduates of LPNU can be employed in research institutions, industrial
establishments and service sector. The high standards of education provided by the
University enable them to be fully competitive on both the domestic and international
markets in the fields of manufacturing and service industries as well as in R and D
activities. A diligent student is sure to get a good job after graduating from the
University.
