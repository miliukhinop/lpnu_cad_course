I am writing because of your advertisement which i found quite catching.

I want to apply as an account executive.
I have been working in this field for 15 years and
during that time I helped a lot of companies grow.

In particular, I have worked at Alphabet as a product manager,
Oracle as an executive and Roshen as a cashier, and
I'd like to help your company as well.
I am also sending my CV to provide you with more information.
