a) I have chosen this speciality, because it fits my requirements best. Since early childhood, I have been tinkering with computers and other electronics.
b) Our university has originated from a Real School formed in 1816 in Austro-Hungarian Empire. It has been renamed, repurposed and reordered a few times, and now it is one of the most popular ukrainan higher education institution. Our institute, on the other hand, is fairly young (it was created in 2001).
c) There are plenty of subjects that are taught, in this term particularly we have calculus, ukrainian language, algorithmization and programming, object-oriented programming and circuitry.
d) Our university consists of many buildings, including research facilities, laboratories prepared for the students, campus buildigs and a few libraries.
e) I know that various AI projects are gaining more and more popularity, and, considering that even a few years ago we didn't even think of the AI in the way we do now, I'd say the world has started to develop much more rapidly, but i'd also say that we don't need half of the tech we have now, we're just overwhelmed by these endless possibilities.
	From what I know about scientific research of my department, it is mainly focused on these:
	- Automatization
	- modeling embedded systems
	- "smart home" systems.

f) Firstly, I'd like to cite one person on this: "computer programming is the closest thing we've got to magic". Indeed, it opens up huge possibilities, even for those that study programming on some basic level. The feeling you get when you create something just by thinking about it is fantastic. And to make a piece of software that people actually find useful and like to contribute to --- that's just other-worldly!

	All that is awesome, but we also need to consider some shortcomings:
	- There is a big competition in the field, also it is created artificially by overengineering. A lot of useless programs are written for commercial purposes and not the benefit of users.
	- If you really want to work for some company or even develop your own thing, you have to constantly learn a lot of new stuff, and when I say a lot, I really mean it. New standarts, frameworks and technologies emerge out of thin air and you're supposed to handle them like a samurai. I have to admit, this gets very tiring.
	- Just like with any human job, a simple mistake can cause a lot of trouble, and if you work with, say, a sensitive data, this can hurt a lot of people.
