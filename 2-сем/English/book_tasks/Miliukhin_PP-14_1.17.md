- I think you should / shouldn’t ...
- If I were you, I would ...
- I think you’d better ...
- I (strongly) advise you (not) to...
- You must/needn’t ...
- Why don’t you ...

# To Irene

I really think you should start using a computer, because:

- You can edit text much faster;
- The need to type something out multiple times will vanish;
- You'll have less messed up documents lying in the trash.

. If you are worried about
viruses, I could advise you to, firstly, learn more about them so that you
know what to avoid, secondly, to use inherently secure firmware and software.
Also, if you don't need it for work, you could just turn off the internet,
and that will prevent any chance of malware download.

# To her boss

I highly recommend you accustom all the workers to computers. Even the most
conservative ones will eventually get that working on a computer is far more convenient and flexible.

If I were you,
I'd not only make people work on them, but I'd also try and make so they do
less repetitive work by automating it. Again, computers are very much your
saviour.

# To her colleague

I can't tell from the text how much work time you spend doing non-work
stuff, but you should consider doing it when you have breaks and not
fill your whole day with nonsense.

Also, don't use corporate phone to call your friends, that's very inappropriate.

# Summary

using computers and motivating employees to engage in work can increase
results by a lot.
